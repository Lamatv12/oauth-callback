## üí° How It Works
oauth-callback captures the OAuth 2.0 authorization code process. Here's how you can utilize it effectively:

1. **Set Up Your OAuth Application**: Register your application with the OAuth provider (like Google, GitHub, etc.). You'll receive client credentials which are crucial for the next steps.

2. **Configure the Callback URL**: Make sure the callback URL points to your local server or the endpoint where oauth-callback retrieves the authorization code.

3. **Run oauth-callback**: Execute the application, providing the necessary credentials and callback URL. The tool will handle the authentication flow, redirecting you as needed.

4. **Capture the Code**: Once authenticated, oauth-callback will capture the authorization code automatically.

5. **Integrate into Your App**: Use the captured code to request access tokens and proceed with your application's OAuth flow.
